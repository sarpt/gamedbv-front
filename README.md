# Wiitdbjs-front

A simple frontend to Wii (and GameCube) text database. More of a personal learning project to learn React and it's ecosystem than anything serious

## Running

```npm run dev-server``` runs development server (placeholder until backend that fetches and parses orginal xml is written)

```npm start``` serves app in a typical create-react-app fashion
